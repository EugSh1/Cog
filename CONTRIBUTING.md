# Contributing to Cog

Thanks for considering contributing to **Cog**!

This project values simplicity, readability, and performance. Please take a moment to read these
guidelines before opening an issue or submitting a pull request.

## Philosophy

-   🪶 **Zero dependencies** — PRs that add dependencies (runtime or dev) will not be accepted.
-   🧠 **Understand before writing** — avoid "clever" code; clarity comes first.
-   🔍 **Minimalist by design** — think twice before adding a feature.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Lint code:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Pull Requests

-   Keep PRs small and focused.
-   Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages.
-   Add tests for new features or bugfixes.

## Code Style

-   Avoid unnecessary abstractions.
-   Code must be formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). We do not include Prettier in the
    project, so please use your editor's extension (e.g.
    [Prettier for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)).
