# Introduction

Welcome to the **Cog tutorial**.  
Cog is an **ultra lightweight (20.7 kB unpacked) HTTP framework** built directly on top of Node.js’s
native `http` module. It aims to provide a minimal, yet powerful foundation for building backend
servers and APIs — without any runtime dependencies.

If you’ve used frameworks like **Express**, you’ll feel right at home with Cog’s API.

-   Create a simple HTTP server
-   Define routes and handle requests
-   Work with query strings and request bodies
-   Use middleware for reusable logic

## Requirements

-   Basic knowledge of JavaScript or TypeScript
-   Node.js v18.15.0 or higher installed
